# AlmaLinux OpenQA

Life is short for manual testing. AlmaLinux testing is made possible by OpenQA.

We are grateful to the OpenSuse OpenQA team for the beautiful product, RedHat, and Fedora team for additional customizations and scripts.

Also, special thanks to our generous sponsors CloudLinux, KnownHost, Equinix Metal, OpenStack, AMD, Ampere, and IBM.
